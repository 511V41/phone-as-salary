# Phone as salary

Provide form and API that can make prank call with synthesized voice to your own phone number.

## Story

In Japanese old web comic "Mission-chan's Great Adventure", Main character who is called "Mission-chan" obtains a black rotary dial phone as salary. However, it can't make a call, so she can only receive calls from someone somewhere.

This repository is developed for the purpose of reproducing that item.
